# About This Project

This project is a **Next.js** application that I built by following a tutorial from [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIbyO-bwdUs). The tutorial served as an inspiration and a learning guide, but the code and implementation were written by myself.

You can see the live demo [HERE](https://cafe-app-nextjs.vercel.app/)

Special thanks to [Cristian Mihai](https://www.youtube.com/@cristianmihai01) for providing the tutorial that inspired this project.

## What I Learned

* Next.js: Although this project was fully frontend and didn't utilize server-side features like getStaticProps or getServerSideProps, I gained valuable experience working with Next.js's framework, particularly in its routing system and file structure, which streamlined the development process.

* React: As my second React project, I further honed my skills in building interactive and dynamic components. This project deepened my understanding of React's state management and component structure, especially within a more complex and structured environment like Next.js.

* Tailwind CSS: This was my first time using Tailwind CSS, and I found it to be an efficient way to style components directly within my JSX. Tailwind's utility-first approach allowed me to create responsive and visually consistent designs quickly, without the need for writing traditional CSS. 
This is one framework that I **REALLY** got more curious about.

* Framer Motion: I utilized Framer Motion to enhance the user interface with smooth animations. I implemented it in the header to create a seamless experience when **opening the hamburger menu** and displaying the menu text. Additionally, I used Framer Motion to create a parallax effect where a coffee mug moved at a different speed compared to the rest of the page, adding depth and visual interest.

* GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform): I used GSAP to implement a unique **horizontal scrolling effect** for the website, diverging from the typical vertical scroll. This involved learning how to control scroll-triggered animations and applying GSAPâ€™s powerful tools to create a custom scrolling behavior that fit the design goals of the project.
_GSAP, you dirty dog. How can you be so damn cool?_

## How to Run the Project On Your PC

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

* **Node.js** (LTS version recommended)
* **npm** or **yarn** (depending on your preference)

### Cloning the Repository

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.

3. Run the following command to clone the repo:
`git clone https://github.com/Vaahtopahvi/cafeapp.git`

4. Navigate into the project directory:
`cd cafeapp`

### Installing Dependencies

After cloning the repository, install the necessary dependencies. You can use either `npm` or `yarn`:

* Using npm
`npm install`

*using yarn
`yarn install`

### Running the Development Server

once the dependencies are installed, you can start the dev server:

* Using npm:
`npm run dev`

* Using yarn:
`yarn dev`

This will start the Next.js development server. You can view the application by opening your browser and navigating to `http://localhost:3000`.
